    <h1>Contact Goofy</h1>
    <p>While Goofy's public persona as a lovable Disney character is widely recognized, there's a mysterious side to him that many are unaware of. Beneath the goofy exterior lies Mr. Smith, a seemingly ordinary individual leading a double life. For inquiries and further information, please contact Mr. Smith at his undisclosed location in The Matrix. Remember, not everything is as it seems, and even the most unexpected characters can have secrets lurking beneath the surface.</p>
